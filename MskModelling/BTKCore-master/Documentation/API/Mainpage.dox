The simplest way to use BTK in your program is to take a look in this \ref GettingStarted "tutorial".

To well understand the concept of pipelines and theirs mechanisms, look at the \ref AdvancedTutorial "advanced tutorial".

And finally, for more informations about the development (code guidelines, unit tests, submit a patch, how to extend BTK's classes, etc) check the \ref Developer "developer's page".
