/**
 @page WarningsID Warnings identifier
 
 @section ListWarnings List of warnings added into Matlab
 
 Matlab gives you the possibility to filter warnings based on their ID to enable or disable them. 
 Using BTK into Matlab can gives you lots of these warnings when, for example, you read a C3D file
 with wrong informations than BTK detects and corrects.
 
By default, the warnings are enabled. To disable them, you have to use the Matlab function @c warning. For example:
@code
warning('OFF', 'btk:ReadAcquisition'); % Disable the warning(s) for the function btkReadAcquisition.
h1 = btkReadAcquisition('myFileWithWarnings.c3d'); % No warning displayed.
% ...
warning('ON', 'btk:ReadAcquisition'); % Enable the warning(s) for the function btkReadAcquisition.
h2 = btkReadAcquisition('myFileWithWarnings.c3d'); % Warning displayed.
@endcode
 
 The following list gives you the ID used by BTK into Matlab:
 - @c btk:AppendForcePlatformType2
 - @c btk:GetForcePlatforms
 - @c btk:GetForcePlatformWrenches
 - @c btk:GetGroundReactionWrenches
 - @c btk:MergeAcquisitions
 - @c btk:ReadAcquisition
 - @c btk:WriteAcquisition
