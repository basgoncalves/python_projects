 @page StructureFieldnameFormat Field's name format in extracted structures
 
 @section FieldnameFormat Character conversion
 
 Matlab has a restricted the list of characters usable for a field's name in a structure. These characters are the capital letters between A and Z, the minuscule letters between a and z, the number 0 to 9 and the symbol underscore '_'. Every letters with an accent will be replaced by the same letter without the accents. Other ASCII characters used in the label (e.g -,*,%,...) will be replaced by the character '_'. Moreoever, it is not possible to start a field's name by a number. Every label starting by a number will be prefixed by the string 'C_'. In the case where two measure has the same label, then the second one is suffixed with '_1'. In the case where more than two measures has the same label, the suffix will increment each time.
 
 For example, if one marker has the label @e uname*1 in the acquisition represented by the handle @c acq. Then using the code <tt>markers = btkGetMarkers(acq)</tt> will return the structure @c markers where one of its field will have the name @e uname_1. The characters '*' will be converted by '_'.
 
 Other examples:
   - '1FE' renamed in C_1FE ;
   - 'FÃ©mur' renamed in 'Femur' ;
   - If 3 markers has the label 'RTOE', then in Matlab you will find 'RTOE', 'RTOE_1', 'RTOE_2'.
   
 You can access to the original (true) label of the points and the analog channels by using the content of the field @c label proposed in the last output of the function btkGetPoints, btkGetPoint, btkGetAnalogs, and btkGetAnalog.
