/**
 * @class btkGetEvents
 * @brief Extract events from a biomechanical acquisition.
 * @syntax{[events\, eventsInfo] = %btkGetEvents(h)}
 * @param h Handle pointing to a C++ btk::Acquisition object.
 * @retval events Structure where each filed corresponds to an event's label
 * @retval eventsInfo Structure with additional informations
 *   - @c eventsInfo.subjects: contains the name of the subject for each event
 *   - @c eventsInfo.units: Structure with one field named ALLEVENTS for the unit used by the events.
 *
 * @par Detailed description:
 * The value of each field in the output @c event corresponds to the time(s) where this event occurred.  
 * If the events represent actions realized by more than one subject, each event starts by the name of 
 * the corresponding subject. The time(s) of each event are reordered. Events are also reordered based 
 * on their first time.
 * \n\n
 * Events' time are computed using the following formula:
 * <tt>t = (event_frame - first_frame) / sample_frequency</tt>\n
 * Hence, an event set to the first frame of the acquisition, will have a (relative)
 * time computed to 0.0 second.
