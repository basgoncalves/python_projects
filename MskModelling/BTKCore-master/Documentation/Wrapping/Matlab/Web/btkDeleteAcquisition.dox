/**
 * @class btkDeleteAcquisition
 * @brief Delete the acquisiton associated with the given handle.
 * @syntax{%btkDeleteAcquisition(h)}
 * @param h Handle pointing to a C++ btk::Acquisition object.
 *
 * @par Detailed description:
 * This function is generally not necessary as Matlab uses a garbage collector
 * to free the memory automatically. However, when you launch a batch and need to
 * extract some parameters from many acquisitions, it is advised to use this function.
 * @verbatim For example:
 * % files: array of cells containing 500 filenames.
 * for i = 1:length
 *   acq = btkReadAcquisiton(files{i});
 *   outcome = computeOutcome(outcome, acq);
 *   btkDeleteAcquisition(acq);
 * end @endverbatim
 *
 * @sa btkCloneAcquisition, btkCloseAcquisition, btkNewAcquisition
