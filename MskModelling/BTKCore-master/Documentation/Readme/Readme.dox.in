@section intro_sec Introduction

BTK is an open-source library for biomechanical analysis. The structure of this library is inspired by the <a href="http://www.vtk.org">VTK</a> and <a href="http://www.itk.org">ITK</a> projects. 

This README is written for BTK version 0.1 and greater. For more information about BTK and additional resources see the web page at <a>http://code.google.com/p/b-tk</a>.

@section organisation_sec Organization

The BTK source code repository is organized into six major sections.

- The toolkit source code is found in the directory @b Code. This directory has the following subdirectories.
  - @b Common: Core classes commonly used by other kits
  - @b IO: Classes for reading and writing data
  - @b BasicFilers: Simple filters to adapt data 
- The @b Examples directory contains ressources to use BTK.
- The @b Testing directory contains lots of testing examples. These are undocumented tests but can be helpful in some cases.
- The @b Utilities directory contains ressources or libraries required to build BTK.
- The @b Wrapping directory contains code related to BTK and various programing language to bridge BTK with them.

@section doc_sec Documentation

The BTK source code is commented and permits to construct the API documentation by using <a href="http://www.doxygen.org">Doxygen</a>. For more information to construct the API documentation, see the option @ref config_doc_api in @ref config_sec "Configuration Options in CMake".

@section pb_sec Common Problems

- Some compiler could not be used with Wrapping/Matlab into some OS. Mathwoks doesn't support all compiler on every platform (Linux/Mac/Windows).

@section data_sec Getting Data

Regression tests in BTK required C3D files. These files are on the net
to reduce the size of the BTK source package. The first time you want to
build the tests (BUILD_TESTING option in CMake), CMake will download the
required files from ftp://ftp.c3d.org. This download take a long time
due to a check betwen EPSV and PASV mode... This problen is due to the
CMake binary option build and cannot be fixed by a script.

@section run_sec Running BTK

Many tests/examples in Testing directory will be compiled if
BUILD_TESTING are enable in CMake. To run these tests, just type CTest
(or "c:\Program Files\CMake 2.6\bin\ctest.exe") or @p bin/TDD from the
build directory. If you have built shared libraries, make sure the PATH
environment variable (Windows) or the LD_LIBRARY_PATH (Unix) point to
the shared libraries (see above documentation of the BUILD_SHARED_LIBS
for details)

@section add_sec Adding A New Class

There are several ways to extend BTK. The simplest way is, in your own code,to create classes that inherit from the appropriate BTK classes. For example a filter/process will inherits from btk::Process until an input/output will inherit from btk::DataObject.
