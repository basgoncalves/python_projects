nteractive Line Graphs (Enhanced):
Event Marking: We can use peaks in the force data or changes in joint angles to automatically suggest key events. Coaches can then confirm or adjust these markers.
Muscle Group Highlighting: When a coach hovers over a muscle group in the spider graph or a muscle name in the legend, the corresponding lines in the line graphs will be highlighted.
Movement Visualizations (Stick Figure FTW):
Given the joint angle data, a stick figure animation is the perfect balance of simplicity and effectiveness.
Force Representation: We can represent muscle force by:
Varying the thickness of the stick figure's limbs.
Color-coding the limbs based on force magnitude (e.g., green for low, red for high).
Synchronization: The animation will be synchronized with the line graphs, so coaches can see how muscle forces correspond to movements in real-time.
Spider Graphs (Impulse):
XML Integration: We'll parse your XML file to automatically generate the muscle group axes for the spider graphs.
Impulse Calculation: We'll calculate the impulse for each muscle group.
Interactive Elements:
Hovering over a point on the spider graph will highlight the corresponding muscle group in the line graphs and stick figure animation.
Allowing the user to select two spider graphs to overlay.


Workflow:

Data Processing (Python): You can still use Python to pre-process your .sto files and convert them into a JSON format that JavaScript can easily read.
Web Interface (HTML, CSS, JavaScript): Use HTML to structure your website, CSS to style it, and JavaScript to create the interactive visualizations.
Visualization Libraries (D3.js, Chart.js): Leverage these libraries to create the line graphs, spider graphs, and stick figure animation.
